# Snake

Current version: 1.0.

## Overview

Who doesn't remember good old Snake? Well, here you have a snake game simulator built in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Because true classics never die.

- **Functionalities**:

You can start the game by pressing **W**, **A**, **S**, **D** or the **Arrow Keys**, and controll the snake's movement with said keys. 
So far, the game just features solid walls, so the snake won't come out through the other side if you hit one of them. You can adjust the speed of the snake, too.

- **Technologies**:

This little game was built using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Although it's definitley not the best way to do it, I wanted to give it a try as a personal challenge, and it was very amusing.

## Installation

The game is currently deployed [here](https://reliable-begonia-e6759f.netlify.app).

If you want to clone the repository and play locally, you can just run it by opening the HTML file in your browser, or with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) if you are using VS Code.

## Resources

I had never developed any sort of game so far, so when I decided to do so, I was a little bit lost, specially regarding "game loops". My first attempt failed miserably after I recklessly threw a while loop at the beginning. But I asked Google, since "ask and you shall receive", and I was blessed with several amazing articles:

1. [How to Make a Game Loop in JavaScript](https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-game-loop-in-javascript/#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9Cgame%20loop%E2%80%9D%20is%20a,and%20then%20drawing%20the%20frame.).
2. [Anatomy of a video game](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Anatomy).
3. [Inventing Games. Game Loop in JavaScript.](https://medium.com/geekculture/inventing-games-game-loop-in-javascript-1cb0a5fcc81b).

## Updates

The game will be updated following, more or less, the following roadmap:

- Control over snake growth.
- Color customization.
- More game modes: no walls, different types of food with different effects...
- Score storage.
